I have over a decade's experience in full-stack web development in the media and
marketing & advertising sectors. I've worked in both very large companies and in startups,
frequently on projects that demand a very quick turnaround.
I pride myself in writing fast, lean code that can be reused and iterated upon.
With degrees in Computer Science and the Sociology of Science & Technology,
I have a holistic outlook on software, able to draw on both perspectives.


I am currently working as a CTO-level contractor, helping startups build stable,
reliable technology to help them launch.
