Hi, I'm Chris. I write software for a living, and I have over a decade's experience in full-stack web development, mainly in the media and marketing & advertising sectors.

I have worked in both very large companies and in startups, frequently on projects that demand a very quick turnaround. I pride myself in writing fast, lean code that can be reused and iterated upon.

With degrees in Computer Science and the Sociology of Science & Technology,
I have a rounded outlook on software and technology, and am able to draw on both perspectives in my work.

I am currently working as a CTO-level contractor, helping startups build stable,
reliable technology to help them launch. If you're interested in working with me, or finding out more about what I've done, then check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username| cgi_escape | escape }}" title="Chris Applegate's LinkedIn">my LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">get in touch</a>.
